<pre class="fragment">Release Information
=================== 
  
This is Release 2.6.0 of the FT9xx Toolchain for Windows, comprising the command-line tools (GCC, GNU Binutils, GDB), the Eclipse IDE and the drivers needed to start development. A set of examples are included to demonstrate how to use the drivers. Projects created with the Bridgetek Eclipse plugin are compiled using a Makefile. Therefore, the latest version of some necessary GnuWin32 utilities (make and coreutils) are also included.

This toolchain adds support for the FT9xx series of Microcontrollers.

Version: 2.6.0

Bootloader
----------
Version: 1.08


Knowledge Base
==============

- The Eclipse IDE distributed with the installer is the 64-bit (x64) version. The Bridgetek plugins is run with a 64-bit version of Eclipse.

- Running the FT9xx Programming Utility requires a Java JRE to be installed. The Eclipse IDE will install a suitable JRE for the Programming Utility which will be used by default. The JRE can be changed by modifying the PATH environment variable or modifying the "FT900Prog GUI Launcher.bat" file in the "Toolchain\programmer\dist" folder.

- Python 3 can optionally be installed. This can be superceded or replaced by newer versions if required. Python 2 versions are not supported.

We welcome suggestions for new features or improvements to existing features.



Toolchain Readme
----------------
Version: 2.6.0

Restrictions:
- Note that from v2.2.1 onwards, the Application Binary Interface (ABI) has changed compared to v2.1.0. So any libraries compiled with toolchain v2.1.0 or below versions must be recompiled/rebuilt to be used in projects compiled for v2.2.1 or later.
- The RTCs in FT90x Rev B and FT90x Rev C are different. So the software that was written for FT90x Rev B cannot run on FT90x Rev C. i.e. it is not forward compatible. However, from toolchain v2.5.0 onwards, the RTC API for FT90x Rev C is made backward compatible to RTC of FT90x Rev B, i.e. all three modules (MM900EVxA, MM900EVxB, &amp; MM930EVxA) can be supported. 


Known issues:
- When building in Eclipse, the build process will sometimes stop with the message:
        make: *** Access is denied.
        .  Stop.
        make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....
	Or build may slow down with messages for anti-virus scanning of the toolchain's ft32-elf-*.exe files. 
  This is a known issue with some antivirus software, such as AVG.
  Workarounds include (depending on the antivirus software):
	- Temporary disable the antivirus software 
	- Add exceptions to every "exe/bat" under the "&lt;installation folder&gt;\Toolchain\tools\*" folder

Fixed issues:
- crt0.S in all the examples and template projects to have default watchdog timeout handler. 
- Linker scripts to account for the .data memory stored in flash. 
- Made the library files in 'Toolchain installation' folder to be 'READONLY', so that they do not get edited in the eclipse IDE.

Feature requests:
- Eclipse plugin provides IoT template projects for AWS, Google Cloud and Azure where the template framework comprises of IoT stack, mbedTLS for secure authentication, lwIP (for MQTT and HTTP exchange) and FreeRTOS.  


Drivers and Examples Readme
---------------------------
Version: 2.6.0

Restrictions:
- N/A

Known issues:
- The ADC rail-rail reference is disabled by default, as a result:
	o Voltages between 0 - 350mV are all read from ADC as zero.
	o Voltages between 3 - 3.3V are all read from ADC as max value (1023). 
- The interrupt library does not work properly when the interrupt priority is changed. 

Fixed issues:
- USBH memcpy calls to use  streamini.x/streamouti.x. 
- Corrected USBD endpoint calculation for 1024 bytes size.  

Feature requests:  
- MMC/eMMC support added
- New examples added are
o    ADC Example 4 and ADC Example 5 (to demonstrate single shot ADC functionality)
o    IoT Example Amazon Web Services (to demonstrate connectivity to AWS with FT90X platform as the IoT node)
o    IoT Example Google Cloud Platform (to demonstrate connectivity to GCP with FT90X platform as the IoT node)
o    IoT Example Microsoft Azure (to demonstrate connectivity to Azure with FT90X platform as the IoT node) 
- USBD UVC Webcam example removed as there is application note AN_414.
- USBH supports SET CONFIGURATION requests sent through the USBH_device_set_configuration API call.
- USBD supports pipes and URBs within an interrupt-driven schema. USBD_process and the callback feature of USBD_create_endpoint have been deprecated.
